/* The intrinsic and optimized version of the hamming distance function
   hamming_distance_ref use the builtin vec_popcnt.  Unfortunately, the
   built-in is only supported on Power 8 and newer systems.  So when compiling
   and running for Power 7 the intrinsic and optimized versions of the
   hamming distance functions must fall back to the base scalar version.
   Set the following #dfine VEC_POPCNT_SUPPORTED to 0 when compiling
   for Power 7 and true for all newer CPUS.  */
